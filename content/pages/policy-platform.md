# Introduction

Sunrise Bay Area is working to achieve a Green New Deal in accordance with the goals shown in the next section. This will require broad social transformation at the international, federal, state, and local levels. This report covers policies which Sunrise Bay Area is pushing for California to make on the state, regional, and local levels to achieve these goals. 

Sunrise principle 10 states “We stand with other movements for change,” and we recognize we won’t do this alone. Solidarity partners are listed in the individual sectors. 

This report breaks down the policies by sector of the state economy, and looks at how to transform these sectors to meet the goals of the Green New Deal, addressing racial inequities, inequalities, and improving the health of communities. The sectors covered are the most polluting sectors of the economy, most responsible for health problems and climate change. We recognize the interconnected nature of our society, and will partner with other organizations pursuing initiatives which align with our principles in other sectors of our society. 

## Green New Deal Goals

1. to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions through a fair and just transition for all communities and workers;
2. to create millions of good, high-wage jobs and ensure prosperity and economic security for all people of the United States;
3. to invest in the infrastructure and industry of the United States to sustainably meet the challenges of the 21st century;
4. to secure clean air and water, climate and community resiliency, healthy food, access to nature, and a sustainable environment for all people of the United States for generations to come; and
5. to promote justice and equity by stopping current, preventing future, and repairing historic oppression of indigenous peoples, communities of color, migrant communities, de-industrialized communities, depopulated rural communities, the poor, low-income workers, women, the elderly, the unhoused, people with disabilities, and youth.

# Industrial

Written by Gershon Bialer (gershon.bialer@gmail.com)

## Introduction

There are a number of manufacturing processes that create harmful carbon emissions. While it may seem to some like a lot of this is covered in California’s current cap-and-trade policies, we really need mandates, and specific policies to ensure we are meeting the goals of the Green New Deal framework. 

Industrial emissions can come from many sectors throughout the economy. While most things can be electrified, other manufacturing processes may be harder to adapt into the new economy. Reducing the use of materials and reducing waste can also help to mitigate the impact in these areas. 

## High-Level Goals

1. Pursue mandates, standards, and subsidies centering people and communities over corporations rather than extending cap-and-trade
2. Eliminate emissions from industrial co-generation plants with standards for phasing out all emissions
3. Phase out concrete and cement emissions
4. 1. Eliminate carbon emissions from making concrete by 2025 (tech seems pretty far along see <https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/19/business/heliogen-solar-energy-bill-gates/index.html>)
   2. Change zoning codes to require green concrete and cement in all new construction
   3. Prioritize the development of new clean energy technologies for industry by establishing a zero-emission performance standard for heat applied to the industry sector and a GHG emission performance standard for cement and concrete production.
5. Reduce use of single-use plastics.
6. 1. Require producers to entirely phase out single-use plastics and other packaging materials.
   2. Mandate greater use of recyclable material wherever feasible
7. Build electronics to last
8. 1. Institute a right-to-repair 
   2. End planned obsolescence
   3. Fund training programs for repairing things
   4. Create repair workshops
   5. Advocate for repair cooperative businesses 
9. Impose additional taxes on the worst polluters to fund these programs. 
10. 1. New taxes should be equitable to hit the worst polluters
    2. Offsets should be limited
11. Require full phase 3 carbon emission reporting for all large corporations doing business in the state
12. 1. Currently businesses are just reporting their direct emissions to CARB
    2. Corporations should report full emissions throughout their operations
13. Develop public-bank programs to finance cooperatives
14. 1. Build upon public banking legislation to establish public banks
    2. Fund startup grants for cooperative businesses
    3. Institute policies for public banks to prioritize funding green cooperatives
    4. Integrate starting or joining cooperatives into state educational programs
    5. Ensure funding for those from front-line communities is prioritized 
    6. Ensure collective bargaining rights for all factory workers in California
    7. Prioritize state funding for green spending towards unionized manufacturing. This should be things like electric buses, trains, and other forms of transit.
    8. Ensure workers can assert collective bargaining rights in every factory in California
15. Reduce emissions from landfills (see <https://www.wastedive.com/news/super-emitters-methane-landfills-nasa-republic-california-waste-management/570850/>)
16. 1. Expand policies to reduce waste sent to landfills
    2. Experiment with new technologies to improve recycling, composting, and emissions from landfills
17. Improve whistleblower protections for workers
18. 1. Provide exemptions to NDAs for workers speaking out about issues of public health or safety
    2. Ensure there are harsh penalties for employers retaliating against employees speaking out about these important issues
19. Prevent leaks from existing fossil fuel infrastructure
20. 1. Require oil & gas companies to repair existing leaks 
    2. Use the latest technology including satellites to detect leaks with public reporting 
    3. Make it easier for the public to report leaks. Then, ensure these reports are investigated and acted upon in a timely fashion. 
21. Adopt green manufacturing standards for industries including: Plastic & Rubber Manufacturing, Paper Manufacturing, Metal Manufacturing, and mining
22. 1. Standards should emphasize full electrification
    2. Where electrification is not possible uses of direct solar heating or clean hydrogen should be prioritized
    3. Only if all that is not possible, emission capture or offsets should be utilized
    4. Where clear solutions exist, mandates should be prioritized over incentives with financial assistance for the less privileged
23. Clean, in-state procurement standards, including requirements for job quality and low-carbon and low-toxicity.
24. Prioritize business and industrial development for good-paying, green jobs
25. 1. Zoning should prioritize industries that are low-emission or will reduce carbon emissions
    2. Economic development funds should only be available for green businesses
    3. Workforce training should prioritize businesses addressing climate change, public health, or addressing disparities
    4. Local hiring standards should be used to avoid gentrification and displacement
    5. Industrial development should be done in a way that prioritizes equity and the needs of front-line communities

# Agriculture

Written by Naomi Flagg (naoflagg@gmail.com) and Mary Chambers (mary.ac04@gmail.com)

## Introduction

The IPCC’s 2019 Special Report on Climate Change and Land indicated that to meet global climate goals, agriculture has to move away from industrialized production dependent on synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and fossil fuels, and toward sustainable and regenerative land management practices.

In 2017, the agriculture sector was responsible for 8% of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions from agriculture consist primarily of nitrous oxide and methane. While 8% is low compared to agriculture’s relative contribution to GHGs in other places, it is worth noting that most of the carbon-intensive agricultural products consumed in California (like meat) are imported. Of the 8% of emissions from agriculture, around 70% comes from livestock production, with dairy facilities being the main contributor. Crop production accounts for approximately 20% of agricultural emissions. Emissions from crop production have actually decreased over the last 20 years, in part due to shifts from flood irrigation to drip and sprinkler irrigation. Conversion of farm land to urban land conversion is also a notable source of carbon emissions. Urban land emits more carbon per acre than agricultural land, and California is losing farmland to development. 

It is actually possible for California’s agriculture sector to become carbon negative, because properly managed agricultural soils can sequester CO2 from the atmosphere. However, this will require fundamental changes to agricultural policies and practices. California has taken steps in the right direction, with programs like the State Water Efficiency Enhancement Program (SWEEP), the Healthy Soils Program (HSP), the Sustainable Agricultural Lands Conservation Program (SALCP), the Alternative Manure Management Program (AMMP), and the Climate Smart Technical Assistance (TA) Program. Unfortunately, these programs do not have adequate funding to meet demand from farmers eager to enroll. 

## Principles to Apply for Agriculture Policy

Do these policies:

* Encourage transitioning to regenerative and/or sustainable farming practices when possible? 
* Support reduction of GHG emissions from farming?
* Support reduction of embodied GHG emissions from farming (e.g. through reducing the use of fertilizers, the production of which emits GHGs)?
* Support increase of carbon sequestration from farming? 
* Include provisions that conform to the latest scientific understanding of agricultural emissions and sequestration, and allow for adjustment in the future to conform to new findings? 
* Address issues of “leakage,” that is, continued GHG emissions from industries that move to other states to avoid emissions restrictions, by incentivizing and prioritizing purchase of California-grown produce?
* Support marginalized groups including young farmers, indigenous farmers, and farmers of color?
* Support the rights of farmworkers and/or improve their working conditions?
* Lead to a sustainable aquifer and prioritize access to water for small farmers over larger agribusinesses?

## High-Level Goals

### State level goals

1. Make California agriculture beneficial for our climate and environment

#### Sub-goals

* Net-zero GHG emissions in California agriculture by 2040
* * Increase prevalence of climate-smart farming and land management practices, including but not limited to:
  * * Gasifying agricultural residue biomass to make hydrogen fuel and CO2
    * Replacing 20% of synthetic fertilizer with compost on irrigated croplands/pasture

#### Strategies

* Financially support climate smart agriculture
* * Provide continually appropriated, long-term funding for climate-smart agriculture programs such as the Healthy Soils Program, the Climate Smart Technical Assistance program, etc. 
  * Redirect the over $400 million that largely goes to a few dairy farms for dairy digesters
  * * Stop incentivizing farm consolidation in animal agriculture
    * Incentivize small struggling animal farms to take up plant-based sustainable farming
* Improve statewide land use
* * Invest in researching climate-smart agricultural practices, including agroecology, regenerative farming, and organic farming
  * Prevent the conversion of rangelands to intensive agricultural systems or urban development
  * Prevent the conversion of agricultural lands to urban development
  * Incentivize community, cooperative and urban farming 
  * Promote improved grazing practices such as rotational/adaptive grazing
  * Promote conversion of irrigated cropland to permanent unfertilized grass cover
  * Promote use of cover crops and perennial crops
  * Promote crop rotations to reduce the use of synthetic fertilizers
  * Promote reduction of tillage to reduced or no-till on irrigated cropland
  * Promote transition to dry manure management systems
  * Manage and restore natural and working lands in California, partnering with tribes to protect tribal forest lands and increase their land base, and supporting efforts to protect and conserve fragile, threatened, and endangered ecosystems throughout the state
* Ensure State and local agricultural guidelines are aligned with the best available science
* * Invest in researching climate-smart agricultural practices, including agroecology, regenerative farming, and organic farming
  * Build flexibility into policies so that they can be updated when new research becomes available, for example clear pathways for new practices to be included in incentive programs or disproven practices to be phased out

##### 2. Protect people

#### Sub-goals

* End exclusions for agricultural workers in labor laws
* Ensure extra social protections for farmers, farmworkers, and agricultural communities to offset the risks and costs associated with making the shift away from climate-intensive practices. 
* Provide education and re-skilling opportunities for farmers and farmworkers to move toward sustainable and regenerative approaches
* Phase out the most harmful pesticides
* Require better protection for farmworkers from harmful pesticides
* Require a living wage for farmworkers

#### Strategies

* Support unionization for farmworkers
* Support changes in immigration policy that undermines farmworkers’ ability to advocate for their needs

3. Make California Agriculture more just and equitable

#### Strategies

* Remove barriers to participation in government outreach, assistance, and civic participation for marginalized groups such as BIPOC, women, LGBTQ+, recent immigrants, etc. 
* * Target support toward young farmers and towards farmers of color, women farmers, LGBTQ+ farmers, and other marginalized groups
  * See other suggestions outlined in the CDFA’s [2020 Report to the California Legislature on the Farmer Equity Act](https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/farmerresources/pdfs/2020FarmerEquityReport.pdf)
* Remove barriers to farming and land ownership for marginalized groups such as BIPOC, women, LGBTQ+, recent immigrants, etc. 
* * Improve access to capital for members of marginalized groups through preferential grant and loan programs
  * Incentivize community ownership of farmland, so that cost of of acquiring farmland is not a prohibitive factor for individuals interested in farming
* Support indigenous communities’ farming and food sovereignty
* * Support co-management or land restitution initiatives to return ancestral lands to indigenous peoples to restore native habitats and grow native foods
  * Fund programs to research and protect native seeds

4. Encourage sustainable consumption

#### Strategies

* Encourage sustainable public procurement
* * Increase subsidies/vouchers for fresh produce for low-income families
  * Require public institutions to procure sustainably-produced agriculture products
* Reduce food waste at all levels of the supply chain

### Bay Area 

1. Make Bay Area agriculture beneficial for our climate and environment

#### Sub-goals

* Increase acres under sustainable or regenerative practices, including but not limited to those outlined in the Healthy Soils Program
* Increase acres of farmland protected 
* Move towards 100% organic certification by 2035
* Improve silvopasture 
* Preserve the region’s limited agricultural lands for local food production, ensuring the long-term viability of these lands for sustainable local food production. 

#### Strategies

* Incentivize farmers to develop ecologically regenerative farming systems that sharply reduce GHG emissions and sequester carbon in the soil
* * Provide incentives and subsidies to farmers for soil health improvements they make and for the carbon they sequester
  * Provide subsidies and incentives for a speedy transformation to sustainable or regenerative agriculture, including a grant program to help farmers transition their land to sustainable or regenerative practices
  * As Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) contracts end, help connect landowners to participating farmers with farmers who want to carry out rigorous conservation practices on a working farm landscape
* Incentivize regenerative grazing practices and silvopasture to reduce GHG emissions and sequester carbon in the soil 
* Adopt farmland loss mitigation programs aimed at preserving farmland while giving landowners the opportunity to recover equity in their property without developing it 
* * Coordinate programs among localities so as to create a level playing field and prevent developers from playing one jurisdiction against its neighbors. Local Agency Formation Commissions (LAFCOs) can help do this by adopting their own policy of requiring cities to mitigate farmland loss as a condition of annexation. 

2. Revitalize and expand local/regional food systems and increase local food sourcing

#### Strategies

* Increase efforts to process agricultural products locally, addressing gaps in the agricultural supply chain
* Develop collaborative marketing with local organizations to create funding streams for projects to support local food production
* Incentivize schools to acquire at least 30 percent of their food from local sources
* Expand urban farming and gardening to support local food production
* * Encourage community gardens in empty lots and new developments in order to maximize both local food production and community engagement
  * Establish a victory lawns and gardens initiative to help urban, rural, and suburban communities transform their lawns into food-producing or reforested spaces that sequester carbon and save water
  * Expand tax credits for greywater, rainwater catchment systems, bioswale and rain gardens to further reduce reliance on municipal water systems.
* Maintain and expand access to fresh, healthy, local foods within our region. 
* * Expand opportunities for small farmers and ranchers to reach local markets more often and in broader geographical areas
  * Preserve and expand farmers’ markets

# Transportation

Written by Elliot Wong (wong.elliott@gmail.com) and Elleanor Thomas (emthomas112@gmail.com)

## Overview

According to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the Transportation sector is responsible for 41% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in California. Further broken down by sub-sector percentages out of total state emissions, that is 28% Light Duty Vehicles (LDV), 8.4% Heavy Duty Vehicles (HDV), 1.1% Aviation, 0.8% Ships, 0.4% Rail, and 1.3% Other and Miscellaneous transportation related emissions. Transportation emits the most GHGs of any single economic sector in the state and is almost double the second largest sector, the Industrial sector at 24%. In order to help move the state in the right direction in mitigating climate change and building a Green New Deal, we need to implement transportation policies that drastically expand and support our public transportation workers and riders, reduce our over-reliance on cars, and improve transit equity and accessibility for everyone in the Bay Area and California, especially those in traditionally underserved and disadvantaged communities.

As the major economic centers in California like the Bay Area Megaregion and LA Metro area continue to see major population increases and project even larger rates of growth in the coming decades, both the operational capacity and environmental sustainability of our traditionally overcrowded highway network and overuse of Single Occupancy Vehicles (SOV) have come into grave question. This demographic change has brought to light the demand and overdue need for an effective and modern public transit network at the state, mega regional, intercity regional, and urban metro levels.

By investing in a strong, robust, and equitable transportation network that sustainably and efficiently moves both people and goods, we can create opportunities for growth that are resilient and long lasting throughout all our communities. It is important that we continually rethink our infrastructure geography and anthropogenic footprint in order to imagine how we can improve it to better suit and meet all our needs, environmentally, efficiently, and most of all equitably.

## High-Level Goals

1. Expand and fully electrify public transit systems 
2. 1. Identify underserved communities and markets and build sustainable transit system connections to them - Commuter Rail, Light Rail, Bus Rapid Transit, Pedestrian and Bike Infrastructure. 
   2. Electrify both the service routes and vehicles as well as the capital construction methods and operations & maintenance practices. 
   3. Efficiently serve first and last mile segments of commutes, as they are the major cause of public transit ridership loss.
3. Provide equitable access to transit to all communities 
4. 1. Ensure that fare pricing is both competitive to driving costs and is not to be increased without community approval and equity based evaluations. 
   2. Provide jobs and opportunities in building and developing transit systems to all communities, especially to those most impacted. 
   3. Enforce Equity as a primary evaluation criteria for all transit system planning and development. 
5. Reduce Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) and Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) relating to the transportation sector.
6. 1. Execute and mandate a transition towards Zero-Emission Vehicles (ZEVs), and in the interim Lower-Emission Vehicles (LEVs). Redirect government funding from other polluting industries to help fund rebates and subsidies that facilitate the ZEV transition. 
   2. Provide both reliable public transit service and competitive fare pricing to incentivize the public to create a modal shift from Single Occupancy Vehicles (SOVs) aka private cars to public transit alternatives. 
   3. Work with employers to create more financial incentives like Commuter Checks to both encourage and assist workers in switching from car usage to public transit. 
7. Promote and incentivize Transit Oriented Development (TOD)
8. 1. Ensure that Land Use and Zoning regulations are flexible enough to allow for the efficient development of TOD communities, while still protecting the interests of the existing communities equitably. 
   2. Mandate an appropriate affordable housing requirement ratio for available units. 
   3. Support the development of Active Transportation projects that encourage bicycle usage and pedestrian activity as well as “Complete Streets” that enable safe, convenient and comfortable travel and access for users of all ages and abilities regardless of their mode of transportation. 
9. Reduce and mitigate the negative impacts of freight transportation and the shipping industry on marginalized communities. 
10. 1. Electrify freight networks so that they cease to pollute the marginalized communities along their corridors. 
    2. Align state agency guidance, programs and planning to adequately address the impacts of freight on air quality, public health, and equity by strengthening coordination in the development and implementation of CARB and CTC’s sustainable freight plans.
    3. Right the wrongs of racial and class injustice that have persisted for generations in marginalized communities that have experienced elevated health and cancer risks due to close proximity to industrial freight and shipping sites. Prioritize public transportation and active transportation projects that promote equity and provide Transit Oriented Development that promotes growth in these marginalized communities while also setting up restrictions against gentrification.

# Oil and Gas Sector Phase Out

Written by Sasan Saadat (ssaadat@earthjustice.org)

## Overview

This is a draft outline for Sunrise Bay Area’s positions related to California’s need to manage the decline of oil and gas extraction. It is absolutely necessary to keep California’s emissions in line with its carbon budget, because oil and gas extraction impose devastating impacts on California’s air, water, and public lands. These practices also negatively impact  the health of communities that live along the path of oil and gas extraction, refining, and delivery. Sunrise should clarify a policy for sequencing policy actions that State leaders can take to guide us through a just transition away from fossil fuel production. In doing this, we should  prioritize frontline communities and protect workers and communities dependent on the industry. 

## Background

California is the seventh largest oil producer in the United States--162 million barrels of crude produced in 2018. The political power of the oil and gas industry in Sacramento is infamous--through the Western States Petroleum Association (WSPA), the California Independent Petroleum Association (CIPA), individual major oil companies such as Chevron and California Resources Corporation, and a strong partnership with the powerful Building Trades labor unions, the industry wields significant legislative influence. WSPA spent $8.8 million on lobbying in 2019--more than any other interest group. 

## High-Level Goals

Last Chance Alliance:

* STOP new fossil fuel projects: Lead by issuing no new permits for oil and gas extraction, fossil fuel infrastructure, or petrochemical projects in California. 
* DROP existing production: Set a national and global precedent by becoming the first oil- producing state to announce a phase-out of existing production in line with the Paris climate goals, with a just and equitable transition that protects workers, communities, and economies.Mandate a plan with a fixed timeline to permanently end all fossil fuel extraction, production, storage, and refining infrastructure in the state.
* ROLL out setback limits: Begin by first phasing out oil production in places that are suffering most from the impacts of fossil fuel extraction—by creating a 2500-foot health and safety buffer zone between fossil-fuel infrastructure and homes, schools, and other sensitive sites.
* Require polluters to cap abandoned oil wells and remediate contaminated sites.
* Cease issuing permits for new oil and gas extraction wells
* Implement a 2,500-foot health buffer zone around homes, schools, and hospitals where production must phase out;
* Develop a plan for the managed decline of California’s entire fossil fuel sector to maximize the effectiveness of the state’s climate policies; and Establish a permanent environmental rehabilitation and infrastructure safety fund, sourced from property and production taxes on existing fossil fuel development, extraction, transportation, and refining.
* Develop a transition plan that protects people whose livelihoods are affected by the economic shift, including raising dedicated funds via a Just Transition Fee on oil production.
* * E.g., Just compensation for workers who are laid off or who would like to retire from the fossil fuel industry or industries reliant on fossil fuels, and the establishment of a fund to support early retirement of workers and fossil fuel infrastructure, as well as training and job placement for workers seeking to transition to the low carbon workforce.
  * Other possible measures include, but are not limited to: income guarantees, right to organize, pension and benefit supports, wage guarantee, retraining, early retirement assistance, and investing in local communities where industries shift.
* Implement a “severance” tax or per-well or per-barrel fee on oil production, using the revenue to help with programs that reduce demand for oil (CA is the only major oil-producer not to have such an oil fee).

# Residential and Commercial

Written by Harlo Pippenger (harlo.p.pippenger@gmail.com)

## Overview

The residential and commercial sector combined make up 12% of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions in this category are primarily from use of natural gas as a heating fuel, in space heating, water heating, and cooking. (<https://ww3.arb.ca.gov/cc/inventory/pubs/reports/2000_2017/ghg_inventory_trends_00-17.pdf>) 

With a California Green New Deal, we should demand zero emissions codes for new residential buildings by 2022, and for commercial buildings by 2025. For existing buildings, we should demand 100% replacement of fossil fuels with electric alternatives by 2045. These goals are part of the [Roadmap to Decarbonize California’s Buildings](http://www.buildingdecarb.org/resources/a-roadmap-to-decarbonize-californias-buildings) by the Building Decarbonization Coalition.  

To ensure a just transition, we must demand that the jobs created in electrification have high wages with strong benefits, and that the state provide adequate training for workers to switch industries. In addition, equity in building electrification must be guaranteed through affordable, accessible programs that address the needs of low-income tenants. All tenants must be legally protected from rent increases that result from building retrofits. 

Affordable housing is a key aspect of a Green New Deal in California that will help ensure economic security for Californians struggling with the ongoing housing crisis. We should demand that California implement the recommendations of the [Homes For All](https://www.dataforprogress.org/homes-for-all) policy agenda developed by Data for Progress. These goals include ending racist exclusionary zoning, building public and social housing, providing immediate relief to renters, and making homes for people, not capital. 

## High-Level Goals

1. Electrify all residential and commercial buildings
2. 1. All new residential and commercial buildings all-electric by 2028
   2. 1. All-electric codes for new residential buildings implemented in 2025
      2. All-electric codes for new commercial buildings implemented in 2022
   3. All existing buildings all-electric by 2045
   4. Support expansion of CCAs, achieving access to 100% renewable electricity for all of California by 2035. 
3. Ensure a just transition for tenants and low-income homeowners. 
4. 1. Protect tenants from rent increases and evictions as a result of energy retrofits
   2. Provide accessible, low-interest financing for homeowners that retrofit their homes
   3. Build public and affordable housing that is all-electric or electric ready
5. Ensure a just transition for workers. 
6. 1. Provide free training for displaced workers to move in to clean energy sector
   2. Prioritize job creation in low-income and frontline communities
   3. Require new jobs in building decarbonization to be unionized with strong wages and benefits
7. Ensure green building practices and materials to protect health of residents
8. 1. WELL, building performance standards
   2. Ensure that sustainability and net zero emissions footprint of a building is maintained beyond construction and is continued in operation and maintenance of building
   3. Indoor air quality and impact on public health is heightened to prevent “sick building” syndrome in both residential and commercial buildings
   4. Reform in Building Code, especially in public owned / affordable housing
9. Establish long-term policies and programs to ensure sustainable residential and commercial development equitably
10. 1. Provide accessible and affordable funding for low-income homeowners to carry out building improvements
    2. Develop funding mechanisms, such as public banks, to provide stable financing 
    3. Defund the police to fund these programs
    4. Ensure that Land Use and Zoning regulations are flexible enough to meet the needs of the communities, while also concretely protecting the interests of these communities. 
    5. Accelerate reductions of air and climate pollution to meet and exceed national ambient air quality standards via the provision of tiered incentives for residential and commercial developments that incorporate design features and operational procedures which work toward the achievement of carbon negativity

## Strategies

* Decarbonization of privately-owned housing and protection of communities of color and low-income residents
* Decarbonization of deed-restricted affordable housing, protection of low-income and communities of color, and preservation of affordable units
* Plan for the equitable decarbonization of energy distribution infrastructure

# Electricity

Written by David Berney Needleman (davidbn1@gmail.com)

## Overview

Electricity accounts for about 15% of CA’s carbon emissions. CA’s transmission grid has also been responsible for several major wildfires in recent years, and this fire risk has led to Public Safety Power Shutoffs. This increases emissions, threatens lives and livelihoods, and is unavoidable with our current grid infrastructure.

A lot of policy work in this sector seems to be promoting specific projects at the local level. We probably have the ability to plug into these efforts through coalition partners like the Greenlining Institute, APEN, and TURN.

In addition to these organizations and those listed below, national non-profits like NRDC, Sierra Club, EDF, EarthJustice, and 350.org have staff that develop policy positions at the state and federal level at least annually.

## High-Level Goals

Efforts at curbing emissions in CA and ensuring the benefits of renewable energy are distributed more equitably have generally fallen into three categories: 

1. Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) that requires utilities (and Community Choice Aggregators) to procure a certain amount of their power from renewable sources.
2. * Currently at 27% (though actual procurements are >35%)
   * Accelerated by 2018 law ([SB-100](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB100))  to 60% RPS by 2030 and 100% carbon-free by 2045.
3. Direct support for deployment of renewable energy, including solar panels and energy storage systems.
4. * Deploy distributed clean energy systems to reduce harm from power outages while improving air quality and offering economic savings to make it easier for Californians to stay safely sheltered in place. Clean, zero-emission, and community-led microgrids that integrate energy efficiency, renewable distributed generation, energy storage, and other technologies should be prioritized for installation in low-income housing and community facilities to protect communities from wildfires and Public Safety Power Shutoffs.
   * Require material assistance from electric and gas utilities to help medical baseline customers stay safely sheltered in place during power outages, e.g., clean backup generation/storage to power needed medical devices.
5. Invest in Community Choice Energy and other municipal and publicly controlled utilities to provide 100% clean energy, with preference for local and on-site generation.

There are groups working on: 

* Accelerating CA’s transition to 100% renewables through an RPS and ensuring that we can meet the RPS standards set 
* Resiliency, including microgrids, other distributed renewables, battery storage, hardening, and non-wires alternatives to transmission infrastructure. 
* Utility structure and regulation (particularly PG&E’s bankruptcy and the conditions put on it by [SB-350](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201920200SB350)), and more access for low-income communities and communities of color to the benefits of distributed renewable energy resources. 
* Just transition for fossil fuel workers and frontline communities.

## Organizations

* Greenlining Institute
* * A lot of resources to help local communities connect to funding and technical assistance for local projects.
  * Transition fund for affected workers
  * Pressuring utilities to participate in climate adaptation
  * * Infrastructure hardening: burying lines, microgrids, etc.

  * * Sona Mohnot may be a policy expert in this area
* APEN
* * Promotes local renewable energy project development and management and 100% renewable Community Choice Aggregation
  * Pushing for statewide financing initiatives for low-income and multifamily renewable energy deployment

  * Transmission and integrated resource planning in line with SB 100 goals
  * David BN has reached out to Vote Solar’s CA director, Susannah Churchill to get more plugged in on their campaigns. They will be launching new ones in the fall.
* Reimagine Power
* Utility Justice/Reclaim Our Power Campaign
* * Envisions a democratized energy system that prioritizes solutions that
  * meet the needs of communities most impacted by our dirty, dangerous energy system: frontline communities that are exposed to dirty gas-fired power plants that poison our air and bodies, the elderly and medically vulnerable who most depend on reliable electricity, low-income households that can least afford skyrocketing electric bills, and immigrant workers and communities displaced by recent wildfires.
  * Values energy as a community resource and human right for enhancing people’s lives and for fueling a sustainable, regenerative, and resilient economy.
